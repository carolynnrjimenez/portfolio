  <h1>Reading & Professional Growth</h1>
  <p>As 2025 wrapped up, I reflected on the books that shaped my thinking as an educator, collaborator, and human. Each book helped me grow in my teaching, leadership, and understanding of the world.</p>

    <div class="book-content">
      <h2>Onward & The PD Book — Elena Aguilar</h2>
      <p>I started <em>Onward</em> in November 2024 and carried “Resilience” as a personal mantra throughout the year, returning to the monthly exercises as grounding anchors during a heavy and uncertain time. As I facilitated learning with adults, Aguilar’s work helped me rethink what it means to support growth beyond the classroom. <em>The PD Book</em> arrived as a recommnedation from a colleague at exactly the right moment!</p>
